                        My name is Dominic, I am 30. I began playing D&D about 14 years ago when I was in high school and attended a tabletop RPG club. From the first time I played, I fell in love with the game. I enjoyed the creativity and community that came with the game. I found myself building characters for fun and starting building whole worlds. I ran my first session
                        around 8 years ago and enjoyed using my characters and homebrew worlds to create memorable moments for players. Over time I have delved into other tabletop game such as Cyberpunk, The Witcher, Exalted and Pathfinder.
                    </p>

                    <p>A little about me, I live in Ohio and have my whole life. I have two cats, one of which has the true spirit of a goblin. I enjoy video games and spend much of my free time worldbuilding and making maps to use in my games. Due to my love of building characters, I often aid others with this, helping them to build detailed and fun characters.</p>
                    <p>I have a partner who I introduced to D&D a few years ago. She also loves it and helps me with some planning and is my tech support (much needed). I switched to running sessions online during the pandemic, and she helps with the technical side of using a virtual tabletop and will be available as needed!</p>

                    <h2>DM Style</h2>
                    <div class="para-text">
                        <p>
                            As a DM I love building rich, living breathing worlds for my players to explore. I prefer running homebrew worlds and encourage extensive roleplay within sessions. I use the rules but adapt them at times to fit the group and the world that you are playing within. If you can give me a good reason why you would be able to do something, we can certainly talk about it! I
                            generally encourage players to use official D&D content to build their characters, but will consider homebrew with the agreement of the entire group.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I like to include challenging combat within the sessions. I believe that it should push your characters, but my aim is never to kill the party. I much prefer players to build characters that are fun to them, rather than being optimal and I will then balance the encounters to suit the party. If there is some weird character build that may not be optimal but you have been
                            dying to try, my table is the ideal place for you.
                        </p>

                        <p>Whilst my personal preference is running my own homebrew words, I am also more than happy to run modules and have experience of doing so.</p>

                    <h2>Session 0</h2>
                    <div class="para-text">
                        <p>
                            I believe that a strong session 0 is essential and sets your game off on the right track. For my table, these sessions are mandatory. It is important to get to know a player before starting a game, to establish the rules of the table and any needs the player may have. It is also an ideal time to discuss any content a player does not wish to see included in the game and
                            understand their expectations. A session zero will include the following:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Discussion of table rules</li>
                            <li>Understand the players expectations</li>
                            <li>Discuss limits and how players can communicate if they are feeling uncomfortable with anything happing either in game, or above the table</li>
                            <li>Discuss how the players can give feedback on sessions to help improve their experience</li>
                            <li>Give a detailed explanation of the setting and potentially a small amount of roleplay to introduce the character into the setting</li>
                            <li>Finish building a character and fill out any gaps in their backstory, tying it into the world</li>
                            <li>Setting up your character on the virtual tabletop</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I welcome new players to my table, and I am more than happy to conduct a more lengthy session 0 with them to walk through the whole character building process. If players do not want to build their own character, I can also provide pre-built characters for them to play. My table is inclusive and I will never tolerate abuse aimed at myself or other players. I want
                            everyone to feel comfortable and enjoy their experience. <br />
