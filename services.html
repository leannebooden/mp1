                    <p>I offer several different services. I primarily run games for D&D 5th edition within my own homebrew worlds and I also offer character building services. These worlds are complex and offer a new experience for players. This is ideal for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and diving headfirst into lore. The homebrew world campaigns I can currently offer are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cerberus Coalition</li>
                        <li>Another Ale for my Friends</li>
                        <li>City of Bones</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I am also happy to run modules. This is great for players who have an adventure in mind but do not want to run this themselves. I can run these modules as written, or I can include my own twist on them. All sessions are offered to both groups and individual players. If you already have a group, I can run the campaign exclusively for your group. However, if you are an
                        individual player or small group, you can join in with other individuals on a campaign. I have full discussions with everyone beforehand to ensure that those joining others they do not know, are likely to match well. If I do not have a space available at the time, I can contact you when there is a suitable group for the game you wish to take part in.
                    </p>

                    <p>All prices are variable. It will depends upon the size of the group, the amount of work involved and the session length requested. Please get in touch for further information.</p>

                            You are a party of young adventures sent on a journey by the king to slay a necromancer that has become a problem for a small village in a distant region of his kingdom. Oddly, he pays your party upfront with a large sum of gold and set you off. After weeks on the road you finally reach the supposed lair of the necromancer. You see a lone tower leaning to one side,
                            crooked as its foundations have begun to crumble from age. The grounds surrounding it lay abandoned covered with weeds and thicket. Thinking you are in the wrong location you're about to leave when you hear the nail biting sound of a rusted hinge giving way as the door to the tower swings open on its own.

                        <p>I love building characters and a service I offer is aiding with character creation. I can meet online with you to bring your concept to life. I offer the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Full character building - this would be starting from scratch. I would help you learn how to build a character with a rich backstory, including how to fill out your character sheet. You can come with an idea for a character, or we can develop one together. <em>Ideal for new players </em></li>
                            <li>Partial Character Building - This is ideal for someone who has a character in mind and it is partially built. I can aid with creating an intriguing backstory to fit in with whatever campaign you will be playing or help fill in any gaps.</li>
                            <li>Hands off Character Building - If you are looking for a character for a campaign but struggle with ideas or just do not have the time to build a character, I can create one for you. You can give me as much or as little information as you like and I can build a character to suit your needs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The characters in question can be for any campaign, whether played at my table or not. I am able to offer support for character building with other TTRPG's but my most extensive knowledge lies within D&D 5th edition.

                                You are a party of young adventures sent on a journey by the king to slay a necromancer that has become a problem for a small village in a distant region of his kingdom. Oddly, he pays your party upfront with a large sum of gold and set you off. After weeks on the road you finally reach the supposed lair of the necromancer. You see a lone tower leaning to one side,
                                crooked as its foundations have begun to crumble from age. The grounds surrounding it lay abandoned covered with weeds and thicket. Thinking you are in the wrong location you're about to leave when you hear the nail biting sound of a rusted hinge giving way as the door to the tower swings open on its own.

                            <p>I love building characters and a service I offer is aiding with character creation. I can meet online with you to bring your concept to life. I offer the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Full character building - this would be starting from scratch. I would help you learn how to build a character with a rich backstory, including how to fill out your character sheet. You can come with an idea for a character, or we can develop one together. <em>Ideal for new players </em></li>
                                <li>Partial Character Building - This is ideal for someone who has a character in mind and it is partially built. I can aid with creating an intriguing backstory to fit in with whatever campaign you will be playing or help fill in any gaps.</li>
                                <li>Hands off Character Building - If you are looking for a character for a campaign but struggle with ideas or just do not have the time to build a character, I can create one for you. You can give me as much or as little information as you like and I can build a character to suit your needs.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The characters in question can be for any campaign, whether played at my table or not. I am able to offer support for character building with other TTRPG's but my most extensive knowledge lies within D&D 5th edition.</p>
